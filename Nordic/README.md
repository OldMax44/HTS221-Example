Nordic nRF52840 Examples

This folder contains two peripheral examples for the HTS221 sensor using SDK 17.0.0 and Segger Embedded Studio (SES). 
Download and add the folder to the SDK ~/examples/peripheral folder to build and execute.

The hts221_onshot example executes a oneshot conversion every 10 seconds and displays the result via the nRF52840 COM port.  
Other log messages are displayed for status and some readings.

The hts221 example sets up for continuous conversions once every 10 seconds.
